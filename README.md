Inference with Aggregate Data: An Optimal Transport Approach

# How to reproduce experiments
This repo contains two branches, which implements the `SBP`(Iterative Scaling with Belief Propagation or Sinkhorn Belief Propagation, [This Branch](https://github.com/zqsh/Aggregate-Inference-MOT/tree/itsbp)) and `NLBP`([This Branch](https://github.com/zqsh/Aggregate-Inference-MOT/tree/nlbp)) respectively.
